# Learning Processing

Processing is a programming language used for visual and animated output.
It was designed at RISD for use by artists and novice programmers.

You can find out more about it at [Processing.org](http://processing.org).

It is built on top of Java and has a number of ports, including one to Javascript
and one to Python.

This repository is to store my work on the exercises in Daniel Schiffman's book
[Learning Processing](http://learningprocessing.com/).
